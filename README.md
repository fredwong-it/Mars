# Mars - Azure Serverless Function in Action

## User Story
A user launches the website and login in. Then she will see a list of courses that she has registered. From there, she can click the course and navigate files.

## Non Functional Requirement 
Keep the hosting cost low. Azure provides a serverless feature. The pricing model is by number of requests, asopposite to VM which you pay for computing hours, even no one accesses it.

Reasonable responding time.

## Design
An Azure Function App with a HTTP trigger will expose an URL to allow a user to access.

The Function App will return SPA

The SPA will communicate a WebAPI which will provide list of files stored on the Azure Blob Storage.
